    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>Kibera is a slum situated to the southwest of Nairobi city centre and is framed by a railroad line and the Ngong River. In an area of about 4 square kilometres there are approximately one million people living, one third of Nairobi’s population and it could even be more; there are no precise figures. People say it is the most densely populated area on earth. People here live in the most basic conditions, in huts made from mud and corrugated iron sheets: open sewers run along the paths, rubbish is everywhere, most of the population are young and many children living here are orphaned. Work is scarce and poorly paid; a few pounds a day is considered a good wage. Kibera is not the only slum in Nairobi, there is probably as many people again in the many other slum settlements around Nairobi.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>Most people living here are uneducated with little chance of changing their circumstances. Teenage pregnancies are rife and these children grow up in the slum with no prospects, no education and continue this cycle of poverty. But these are a wonderful people, even though they have nothing, they are cheerful, generous and welcoming.
</p><p>There have been many attempts to bring change to these slums. Millions have been spent on building tower blocks for re-housing, but these just scratch the surface and, like the 60s tower blocks of the UK, they bring complains of a loss of community. Many charities are keen to give handouts and sponsor individuals but these activities just help to build a dependency culture.
</p><p><br></p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>Our vision is to bring transformation to these slum areas of Nairobi and to fight the spirit of poverty and hopelessness that exists there. We will bring hope, restore dignity and purpose to lives that could otherwise be wasted just in pure survival. Is this possible? It will take time undoubtedly, but like the parable of the loaves and fishes we believe that if we bring our talents to bear then God will perform miracles and make this ministry truly amazing.

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Our first principle is that these people must be responsible for helping themselves. Handouts and aid just perpetuate poverty and generate a dependency culture. We will need support, yes: but as a pump primer, a kick-start, for building profitable businesses. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">These businesses will then invest their profits in the community to help build other businesses and provide training and schooling; a typical social enterprise model. So, as local people are employed and manage these businesses, they will start to bring change to the community. Their work will not just be about survival or generating profits for some distant shareholders, but about investing in and changing their community.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>We must create leaders to run these businesses, people who are confident and educated and who are capable of bringing sustained development and growth. This cannot happen overnight, it will take time, but as the mustard seed grows into the largest tree in the garden, so we will start small and grow: we will take talented local people, train and inspire them, give them a vision to build businesses that will transform these communities. </p><p><br></p><p>Most people starting a business in these areas are happy if it simply supports them, we will challenge this culture as we want local people to be able to run these profit generating businesses. We will develop businesses that service the more affluent population of Nairobi, where prices and profits are higher and cash can be brought into the community.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>To achieve this transformation it is essential to clean up these areas. Living among the open sewers and rubbish, having to look out where you are walking - the “flying toilets” of Kibera are infamous – make it impossible to have a sense of pride or honour in where you live and cause serious infections and diseases. </p><p><br></p><p>In my last visit to Nairobi, we took a short cut through the slum, and I was struck at how the worst thing about the slum was the smell and mess, rubbish, stinking streams, bags of sh*t etc. I thought how these people had lost any pride in their environment. </p><p><br></p><p>The mess signalled to me of a people who had lost hope, pride and honour. I believe that a clean Kibera would indicate a people who had regained their pride and honour, a people who have hope.</p></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>Our initial plan is to start a bakery: a bakery is a profitable business, only flour, yeast and water is needed to produce a premium product, and it is a business that can be easily up-scaled. The initial bakery will be located close to Kibera in an area with high footfall. It will be an ideal location to train and develop staff. This business will be expanded by starting other local bakeries in middle and upper class neighbourhoods with staff trained in the Kibera bakery.&nbsp;</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead">There is a large middle-class in Nairobi with the income to buy quality breads and cakes. Other small businesses, such as milk ATMs and tailoring, will follow where suitable opportunities are found. These businesses will be able to provide specialist training to their workforces for technical skills, inspiration to support the community and good products for people living in the area.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>When funds allow, it is planned to buy land near to the slum. This is seen as a crucial long term investment as the value of land is always rising. This land will be used for building an adult training facility and school. The purchase of land will provide security and ensure the availability of these facilities for decades to come. The adult training facility will provide technical skills training and academic teaching to support those who did not have childhood schooling.</p></div>

Our vision is to develop cost positive ways to tackle this pollution so that it can be permanently eradicated. The major source of pollution is human waste, with around a million people and very few facilities. This causes all the waterways to be open sewers generating a pervasive stink everywhere.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>There are ways to treat this waste to turn it into useful products, such as charcoal, fertiliser or to extract gas.

We believe that such a scheme, properly planned, would be able to attract the necessary development aid grants.</p></div>
